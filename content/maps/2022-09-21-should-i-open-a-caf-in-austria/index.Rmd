```{r message=F, echo=F}
library(sf)
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
data = read_sf(here("static", "data", "graphs", "cafes_oe", "cafes_oe_geo.gpkg"))
```


These are all the coffee shops I found in Austria. There seem to be rougly 16 thousand of them. Although I guess many slipped through my analysis althoug being in the osm-database. Anyways lets look at them in more detail to find out if and where I should open a coffee shop in Austria?

## Where are the most?

I am not really sure which administrative subdivision this is, but anyways, where are the most coffee shops?

```{r echo=F}
library(gt)
data %>% 
  st_drop_geometry() %>% 
  count(city) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) %>% 
  rename(
    City = 1,
    `#`= 2
  ) %>% 
  slice_head(n=20) %>% 
  gt()
```
